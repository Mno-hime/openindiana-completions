# OpenIndiana completions

This is a set of Bash completions specific to illumos distributions like OpenIndiana.

We cover illumos-specific commands not found in the [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion) project.

OpenIndiana users are expected to consume this project via the `utility/bash-completion`
[component](https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-userland/tree/oi/hipster/components/shell/bash-completion)
as it agregates stable version of openindiana-completions.
